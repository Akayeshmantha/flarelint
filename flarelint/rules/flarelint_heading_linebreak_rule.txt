message:

Hidden line break in a heading element. This line break could cause a
broken page header or footer in PDF.  To fix, open the topic in the
text editor (raw XML) and make sure that the contents of the element
are all on one line.

*Tip:* If there are keyword (`MadCap:keyword`) elements in the
heading, move them to the first paragraph.
