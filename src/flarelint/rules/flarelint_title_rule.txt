message:

The HTML `title` element contains text.  Flare prefers using this
text, when it exists, instead of the topic's `h1` title when
generating online help.  We prefer the latter to make maintenance
easier and avoid surprises.  For example, when these elements do not
have identical content, the links in the See Also sections and search
results of online help have different names than the topic title.  To
fix, right-click the topic in Content Explorer, then in the Topic
Properties tab, delete Topic Title.
