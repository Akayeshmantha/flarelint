message:

A title contains an asterisk (“*”).  MadCap Flare version 8 (and
possibly other versions) will not put a cross-reference to this topic
in a relationships proxy for PDF targets.  To fix, remove or replace
the asterisk with something else. Also, update TOC entries that refer
to this topic. Finally, publicly shame MadCap for such an arbitrary,
confounding, time-wasting bug. (Still bitter.)
