Inconsistent punctuation in a bullet list (`ul`).  All items in a list
must consistently use uncapitalized phrases (except, of course,
product and proper names) with no ending punctuation, or full
sentences with first words capitalized and ending punctuation.
Accepted ending punctuation is ., ?, and !.  To fix, adjust the
capitalization and punctuation.
