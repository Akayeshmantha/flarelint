        <h1>Message Section</h1>
        <p>Specifies the text to insert in a report when an element fails a rule. A rule file must contain a single <code>message</code> section. The <code>message</code> section must be after the <code>test</code> sections.</p>
        <p>When a matched element in a matched file fails all tests in a rule, <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> considers the rule to be broken  and inserts the rule's message in its report. In other words, this is the only part of a rule that a reader of a <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> report might actually see.</p>
        <p><span class="admonishment">Tip: </span>A message should, at a minimum, answer the question "Why did the matched element break this rule?" Ideally, the message should also include a solution and other guidance.</p>
        <p>For example:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">message:<br />Missing period at the end of a sentence. To fix, insert a period.<br /></pre>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> ignores line breaks in a message. It places all text in a message into a single paragraph in the report.</p>
        <p>For example, the following message section gives the same result in the report as the previous example:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">message: Missing period at the end of a 
sentence. 
To fix, insert a period.<br /></pre>
        <p>The message section can use simple markdown-like syntax. For bold, wrap text in asterisks (“*”). For monospace code, wrap text in back-ticks (“`”). For emphasis, wrap text in underscores (“_”). </p>
        <p>If you want to use these special characters literally, you can prefix them with a backslash ("\").</p>
        <p>For example, the following shows a message section and how it appears in a FlareLint report:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">
message:
Missing title (`h1`). *To fix:* add a title to the </pre><pre xml:space="preserve">beginning of the topic body.</pre>
