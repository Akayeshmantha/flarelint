        <h1>Defining a Standard Set of Rules</h1>
        <p>You can specify a set of rules that your team uses. By standardizing the rules that each member of your team uses, you can ensure that your Flare projects are consistent. </p>

            <li>
                <p>Each time you add or remove rules in the shared folder, ask each member of your team to copy and replace the contents of their existing personal shared rules folder, <code><MadCap:variable name="Var.PersonalRuleFolder"></MadCap:variable></code>, with the contents of the shared <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> folder.</p>
