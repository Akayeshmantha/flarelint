        <h1>Managing Rules</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> comes with a default set of rules. You might find that some are too general, too specific, or not relevant for your projects. Or you might want to confirm which rules <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> uses.</p>
        <p>You can view which rules are active and specify a standardized set of rules for your team.</p>
        <p>The rules that <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> applies are  in your personal rule folder, <code><MadCap:variable name="Var.PersonalRuleFolder" /></code>. </p>
        <p>The <code>%APPDATA%</code> variable is defined by Microsoft Windows to refer to your personal application data. For example, in Windows 7</p>
        <p><code><MadCap:variable name="Var.PersonalRuleFolder" /></code>
        </p>
        <p>expands to </p>
        <p><code>C:\Users\<em>username</em>\AppData\Roaming\FlareLint</code>
        </p>
        <p>where <em>username</em> is your user account on your computer. </p>
        <p>The file names for rules end with <code>rule.txt</code>. The files for default rules have names starting with <code>flarelint_</code>. </p>
        <p><span class="admonishment">Tip:&#160;</span>If you create your own rules, consider using file names that start with something descriptive, like the name of your team or company. </p>
        <p>For example, the following is a personal rule folder containing a mix of default rules and custom rules. The custom rule files have names that start with <code>acme</code>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/RulePersonalFolder.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The first time you run <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" />, it first checks to see if your personal rule folder exists. If it does not, <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> installs its default rules.    <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> does not delete, modify, or overwrite the rules that are already in your personal rule folder. Like any other rules, you can add and remove default rules to and from your personal folder.</p>
