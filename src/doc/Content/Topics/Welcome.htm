        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> <MadCap:variable name="Var.Version" />!</p>
        <p>FlareLint scans a MadCap Flare project for adherence to your style rules then displays a report in your preferred web browser. It's like picking the lint off your sweater, only more fun.</p>
        <p>Use <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> to make production of your MadCap Flare output faster and less tedious. Use it to produce more consistent, higher-quality content for your end users.</p>
        <p>FlareLint catches many of the problems that you find or miss during
production.  FlareLint looks for breaks from your style conventions
that Flare reports can't detect.  For example, FlareLint reports when
a topic does not start with an <code>h1</code> element.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> is not suited for catching language and visual errors including spelling, grammar, layout, and so on. Writers are better equipped to find and solve these problems.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> works independently of MadCap Flare. It inspects source
			files in Flare projects directly and does not rely on Flare's
		output. <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> does not modify your Flare project or its source files. You don't have to open a project in Flare or build a Flare target before using <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" />. </p>
