You can use FlareLint to make production of your MadCap Flare projects
faster and less tedious.  Use it to produce more consistent,
higher-quality content for your end users.

FlareLint catches many of the problems that you find or miss during
production.  FlareLint looks for breaks from your style conventions
that Flare reports can't detect.  For example, FlareLint reports when
a topic does not start with an h1 element.

To get started:
