        <h1>Reading a Report</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> saves your report in the same folder as your project. Its file name is <code><MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" style="mc-tag-and-class: kbd;" />Report.html</code>. <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> does not resolve references to variables, snippets, cross-references, conditional text, and so on. So interpret its messages with that in mind.</p>
        <p>A <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> report has a header and a list of files in the project that caused errors or warnings.</p>
        <p>The header lists the file name of the project, date that <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" /> generated the report, the Windows user name of the person who started <MadCap:variable name="Var.FlareLint" />, and the number of errors and warnings.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Each Flare file in the list of files has at least one error or warning. The report does not list files that result in no errors or warnings. </p>

        </p>
        <p><span class="Admonishment">Tip:</span>&#160;To view a Flare file in a new browser window or tab, click its file name.</p>
        <p>Each error and warning describes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>type of message, error or warning</li>
            <li>XML&#160;element in which it occurred</li>
            <li>contextual information from the element</li>
            <li>error or warning message itself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Error messages have red vertical bars. An error describes a problem that will give unintended output or cause production failure.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Warning messages have yellow vertical bars. A warning describes something suspicious that needs further investigation from the user. Or it describes a situation that is not a show-stopper but could result in better content if it is fixed.</p>

        </p>
        <p><span class="Admonishment">Tip:</span>&#160;Establish guidelines on handling errors and warnings. For example, your team might decide that all errors must be fixed but warnings are acceptable.</p>
